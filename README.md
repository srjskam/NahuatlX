Text from Nican Mopohua (https://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/nican/nican1.html):

> 021. Auh in mizquitl, in nopalli ihuan occequin nepapan xiuhtotontin oncan mochichihuani yuhquin quetzaliztli. Yuhqui in teoxihuitl in iatlapalio neci. Auh in icuauhyo, in ihuitzyo, in iahuayo yuhqui in cozticteocuitlatl in pepetlaca. 
 
> 021. And the mesquites and nopals and the other little plants that are generally up there seemed like emeralds. Their leaves seemed like turquoise. And their trunks, their thorns, their prickles, were shining like gold.
